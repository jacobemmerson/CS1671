### Jacob Emmerson
Due: November 20th @ 11:59pm

## About

This assignment focused on vector semantics and representations as well as weighting techniques; these were evaluated using cosine similarity. 

All code was written in Python v3.11.4 in WSL2 on an Ubuntu distribution (v.?)

_Packages_
- **Jupyter** v1.0.0
- **NumPy** v1.24.3
- **SciPy** v1.10.1

`writeup_jte27.ipynb` requires the following package(s) **IN ADDITION** to the packages previously listed:
- **Pandas** v2.0.3

## Running the Code

The script contains outlines the functions, thus *running it will do nothing*. To import the script for use, place the following at the top of a separate script or jupyter notebook:

    import hw4_skeleton_jte27.py *

All necessary functions are outlined within `hw4_skeleton_jte27.py` and used in `writeup_jte27.ipynb`.
