### About
---
This script goes over basic regular expression practice as well as file parsing and string manipulation in Python using the regex module.

The following Regular Expression Methods were developed in WSL with an Ubuntu in a Conda ENV Python Version: 3.11.4

The methods were developed, tested, and QA'd in a Jupyter notebook prior to exporting the script.

Several packages are installed on the environment, though none were actively used in the development of the script.

### Running the Code
---

To run the python script, paste the following into the command line:
`python3 python_questions.py`

Not included in the script are the file pathes for the wine processing text and stop words.
